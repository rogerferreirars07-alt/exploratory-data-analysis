## 📊 Project Highlight — Data Visualization Dashboard

One of the main projects in this repository is a **Data Visualization Dashboard**
developed to analyze social and economic indicators using a real-world dataset.

### Dashboard Objectives
- Explore and analyze key indicators through visual analytics
- Identify patterns, trends and disparities in the data
- Communicate insights clearly through visual storytelling
- Support data-driven decision making

### Dashboard Features
- At least **six different visual elements**, including:
  - Bar charts
  - Line charts
  - Distribution plots
  - Comparative visualizations
  - Aggregated indicators
- Consistent use of colors, labels and visual hierarchy
- Clear narrative structure (storytelling) connecting the visuals
